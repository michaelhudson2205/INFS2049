In this practical we will by analysing $2^{k}$ factorial experiments. These are a special subcategory of factorial experiments where each of the *k* factors have only two levels. The experiment is still considered full factorial i.e., run across all possible combinations of factor levels.

**Q.** If we were to consider a $2^{3}$ factorial design with two replicates, how many runs will there be of the experiment in total? What about the same design with 10 replicates?

The data we will be using in today's practical comes from an experiment in 'Statistics for experimenters' a textbook by Box, Hunter and Hunter (Box & Hunter^2^ for short). The design is a $2^{3}$ factorial to study the effect of temperature (T), concentration (C) and catalyst (K) on yield (y). Temperature (measured in degrees celsius) has two levels: 160°C and 180°C.
