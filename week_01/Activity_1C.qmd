Note: this practical is adapted from INFS 2049 Experimental Design - Practical 1 by Joshua Chopin 2021

Welcome to the first practical of *Experimental Design*! In this course, you will use the **R programming language** to explore data, perform statistical tests, and design experiments. This first practical will serve as a refresher on using R and introduce a few basic statistical tools.

### **What to Expect:**

In this practical, you will:

1.  Familiarise yourself with R and its capabilities.
2.  Explore and visualise an open-source dataset using different approaches.
3.  Practice applying basic statistical tools to analyse data.

The dataset for this activity is the **palmerpenguins** dataset (Horst AM, Hill AP, Gorman KB (2020). palmerpenguins: Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) penguin data. R package version 0.1.1. <https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/index.html> (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.3960218)).

This dataset originates from the **Palmer Station in Antarctica** and contains observations of penguin species, including information such as species name, flipper length, and sex, among other variables. The dataset features three species of penguins: **Chinstrap**, **Adélie**, and **Gentoo**, each offering unique characteristics for analysis.

-   **Adélie Penguins**: Named after Adélie d'Urville, the wife of the French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville, who first documented this species.
-   **Chinstrap Penguins**: Easily recognisable by the distinctive black band under their chin, resembling a strap.
-   **Gentoo Penguins**: Their name's origin is less clear, though it might trace back to historical colonial or linguistic interpretations.

As you work through the tasks, you will encounter questions marked with **Q**. While you are not required to submit answers, engaging with these questions by trying them out in R will help solidify your learning.

### **Instructions:**

This practical is self-paced, allowing you to work through the material at a time that suits you. To get started, ensure that:

-   You have R and RStudio installed on your computer.
-   The **palmerpenguins** package is installed in your R environment.

Take your time to complete the tasks, experiment with the code, and reflect on the results. The goal is to build your confidence in using R and applying statistical concepts.

**1. Loading the data**

In R, there are two main ways to access the **Palmer Penguins** data for this practical. While the dataset is conveniently available as part of a package, it is common in real-world scenarios to work with raw data files line .csv. Below, you'll find instructions for both approaches.

**Option 1: Using the palmerpenguins Package** The dataset is included in the `palmerpenguins` package, which you can install and load using the following commands:

```{r}
# Install (if required) and load the palmerpenguins package
# install.packages("palmerpenguins")

library(palmerpenguins)
```

To see the datasets available in the package, use:

```{r}
# List datasets in the package
data(package = "palmerpenguins")
```

![Figure 2: Screenshot of the datasets in the palmerpenguins package](Figure2.png)

The package provides two datasets: **penguins** and **penguins_raw**. For this practical, we will use the cleaned **penguins** dataset.

**Option 2: Using the provided .csv file** If you'd like to simulate a more typical scenario, you can load the data from the provided .csv file. This requires the `readr` package, which you can install and use as follows:

```{r}
# Install the readr package (if required)
# install.packages("readr")
```

If you choose to use the .csv file, we assume that the dataset has already been downloaded and saved in your **current working directory**. Here's how you can confirm and manage your working directory in R:

-   **Check Your Current Working Directory**: To verify your current working director, use the following command:

```{r}
# Check the current working directory
# getwd()
```

The ouput will display the folder where R is currently looking for files. Ensure the `penguins.csv` file is in this directory.

-   **Change the Working Directory**: If the .csv file is located in a different folder, you can update your working directory using the `setwd()` function. For examp-le:

```{r}
# Change the working directory (replace with the path to your folder)
# setwd("path/to/your/folder")
# Verify the change
# getwd()
```

Load the csv file:

```{r}
# Load library
# library(readr)

# Load the dataset from a csv file
# penguins2 <- read_csv("penguins.csv")
```

| \## Rows: 344 Columns: 7
| \## -- Column specification ----------------------
| \## Delimiter: ","
| \## chr (3): species, island, sex
| \## dbl (4): bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g
| \##
| \## i Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
| \## i Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

<br/> From this point onward, the practical will assume you are using the `penguins` dataset loaded directly from the `palmerpenguins` package.

If, for any reason, you prefer to use the dataset from the .csv file, make sure to adjust the commands accordingly to reference the **penguins2** variable instead. Alternatively, you can rename **penguins2** to **penguins** for consistency.

**2. Explore the dataset**

**Inspecting the Data with head()**: The `head()` function provides a quick look at the first six rows of the dataset, showing column names and a preview of the data types in brackets:

-   **fct**: Factor (categorical variable)
-   **dbl**: Double (numeric variable with decimals)
-   **int**: Integer (numeric variable without decimals)

In the output, you might notice that additional columns, such as `year`, are part of the dataset but not fully displayed due to space constraints.

```{r}
# Display the first six rows of the dataset
head(penguins)
```

**Examining the Structure of the Dataset with `str()`**: The `str()` function, short for *structure*, provides a concise summary of any R object. For data frames like this one, it shows the number of rows and columns, the data types of each variable, and the factor levels for categorical variables.

For example, you'll see that **Species** has three levels: `Adelie`, `Chinstrap`, and `Gentoo`, while **Island** also has its distinct set of factor levels.

```{r}
# Display the structure of the dataset
str(penguins)
```

![Figure 3: Bill dimensions](culmen_depth.png)

**Exploring Basic Descriptive Statistics with `summary()`**: The `summary()` function generates key descriptive statistics for each variable:

-   **Factor variables**: Counts of each level (e.g., 152 Adelie penguins, 68 Chinstrap, 124 Gentoo)
-   **Quantitative variables**: Minimum, mean, median, maximum, 1st quartile, and 3rd quartile values.
-   **Missing data (NA)**: Counts of missing values for each variable.

If you're unfamiliar with penguin anatomy:

-   **Flippers**: Penguins' arms, used for swimming.
-   **Bills**: Their beaks or mouths, measured by length and depth (See Figure 3 for reference).

```{r}
# Generate summary statistics for the dataset
summary(penguins)
```

<hr/>

**Q. What does the second quartile represent? Is it included in this summary?**

<hr/>

**3. Data visualisations with base R**

**Barplot of Species Counts** First, we can create a barplot to visualise the number of observations for each species in the dataset. Using the `table()` function, we generate counts of each species and then pass this to `barplot()`.

```{r}
# Create a table of species counts
speciescounts <- table(penguins$species)

# Generate a simple barplot
barplot(speciescounts)
```

**Observation**: In this initial barplot, some labels may be cut off due to size constraints. To address this, we can adjust the plot's appearance using additional arguments in the `barplot()` function.

**Enhancing the Barplot**: By modifying parameters like label size (`cex.names`), orientation (`horiz`), bar colours (`col`), and label alignment (`las`), we can improve the barplot's readability and aesthetics.

```{r}
# Enhanced barplot with customisation
barplot(
  speciescounts,
  horiz = TRUE,
  col = "darkblue",
  las = 1, # Rotate axis labels to horizontal
  cex.names = 0.75 # Reduce label size for better fit
)
```

To explore additional customization options for barplots, refer to the documentation:

```{r}
# ?barplot
```

**Boxplot for Exploring Bill Depth** Boxplots are a powerful tool for visualising the distribution of a numerical variable across different groups. Here, we create a boxplot to compare **bill depth (mm)** among the three penguin species.

```{r}
# Create a boxplot of bill depth by species
boxplot(bill_depth_mm ~ species, data = penguins)
```

**Key Observations from the Boxplot:**

- The **median bill depth** of Adelie and Chinstrap penguins is similar.
- The **range of bill depth** for Adelie penguins is wider than for Chinstrap penguins, indicating greater variability.
- Gentoo penguins appear to have a **significantly smaller bill depth** compared to the other two species.

To explore the strengths and limitations of boxplots further, you can refer to this resource: <https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/boxplot.html>

**Q. What other hypotheses or conclusions can you make from the boxplots?**

**4. Beyond Base R: Visualisation with ggplot2**

While Base R offers various visualisation tools with plenty of customisation options, ggplot2 (or simply **ggplot**) has become the most popular package for creating more complex and aesthetically pleasing plots. It is part of the **tidyverse** ecosystem, which includes tools that will be useful throughout your analysis journey.

**Installing ggplot2** You can install **ggplot2** either as part of the **tidyverse** package or on its own:

```{r}
# Install ggplot2 via tidyverse
# install.packages("tidyverse")

# Or install ggplot2 alone
# install.packages("ggplot2")
```

```{r}
# Load the tidyverse suite
library(tidyverse)

# Or load only the ggplot package
# library(ggplot2)
```

For more details on ggplot2, refer to the following resource: <https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-visualization.html>.

**ggplot2 Basics** In ggplot, visualisations are built from three main components:

1. **Data**: The dataset to visualise.
2. **Coordinate System**: Defines how data is mapped (e.g. Cartesian coordinates).
3. **Geoms (Geometric Objects)**: Visual marks like points, bars, lines, etc., which represent data.

**A simple workflow** involves:

1. Creating a base plot with `ggplot()`.
2. Adding geoms, labels, and themes layer by layer.

Here's an example of a simple histogram to visualise body mass:

```{r}
# Histogram of body mass with ggplot2
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "skyblue")
```

**Handling Missing Values** When you run the above code, you might notice a warning about missing values. We can identify and locate these **NA** values:

```{r}
# Identify rows with NA values in the body_mass_g column
which(is.na(penguins$body_mass_g))
```

The warning indicates two missing values in the `body_mass_g` column. Missing values can occur elsewhere in the dataset too, so it is essential to handle them appropriately depending on the context and your analysis goals.

**Removing Missing Values** For simplicity, let's remove any rows containing missing values and create a new dataset:

```{r}
# Remove rows with NA values and create a new dataset
penguins3 <- na.omit(penguins)
```

We can check how many rows were removed:

```{r}
# Compare row counts before and after removing NA values
nrow(penguins) # Original dataset
```

```{r}
nrow(penguins3) # Dataset without NAs
```

Removing NAs ensures cleaner data for further visualisation and analysis. However, **always consider the implications of omitting data**, especially when the proportion of missing values is significant.

**Scatter Plot with Linear Model** The first visualisation uses `geom_point` to create a scatter plot showing the relationship between **bill length** and **flipper length** for each penguin species. Then, `geom_smooth(method = "lm")` adds a linear regression line for each species.

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins3, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, colour = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

In this plot:

- **Gentoo penguins** have the largest flipper lengths.
- **Chinstrap** and **Adelie** penguins show a similar flipper length, but their bill lengths differ significantly.

**Density Plot by Island** The second plot uses `geom_density` to create overlapping density plots of **bill depth** for penguins found on different islands.

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins3, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, fill = island)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)
```

This visualisation highlights that penguins on **Biscoe Island** tend to have smaller bill depths than those on the other islands.

**Stacked Bar Plot by Species and Island** The next plot uses a stacked bar plot (`geom_bar(position = "stack", stat = "identity")`) to show the distribution of penguin species across the islands.

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins3, aes(x = island, y = species, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack", stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank()) +
  ylab("Count")
```

This plot confirms that **Gentoo penguins** are found exclusively on **Biscoe Island**.

**Barplot of Mean Flipper Length by Species** We can use **aggregate** to compute the mean **flipper length** for each species. Then, we plot these means using a bar plot in ggplot.

```{r}
# Calculate mean flipper length per species
flipper_means <- aggregate(penguins3[, 5], list(penguins3$species), mean)
flipper_means
```

```{r}
# Plot the mean flipper length by species
ggplot(data = flipper_means, aes(x = Group.1, y = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

<hr/>

**Q. Why do we need the `stat = "identity"` inside of `geom_bar` and what does it mean?**

<hr/>

<hr/>

**Q. Can you change some aesthetics to make our last barplot look nicer?**

<hr/>

<hr/>

**Q. Create two new plots that weren't used in this practical using graph types from the ggplotcheat sheet.**

<hr/>

<hr/>

**Q. (Harder, uses previous R syntax knowledge). Create a scatter plot coloured by species, with bill length along the x-axis and flipper length along the y-axis, but only using data where the body mass is greater than 3700 grams. Then create the same plot, but when body mass is less than or equal to 3700 grams.**
